That an accurate Investigator can never be satisficd with the
Verlions of Hickes, we presume is clearly established. The Author
seleested for our farther animadverfions is David Wilkins, the labo-

their errors have proceeded from their pursuing the study of Anglo-
Saxon Learning through the medium of the Latin Languagc.
