There never was an Herefiarch‚ that displays not his want of
common sense and judgment, when he attempts to pervert the
Doftrine contained in these fimple and sublime Verses, whether
Arius, Crellius, or Gilbert Wakefield. The Transsation of the
fourth verse by the last, in his lately edited English Testament‚
surpaffes, if possible, in absurdity, the whimfies of all his prede-
ceffors. “ What was made had Life in it, and this Life was the
Light of Me11.” That is, what was itself created, was the Cause
of Creation to all created Beings‚ “ All things were wrought
thorough him.'’ But as controversial Divinity is not our immediate
Subje5t‚ we shall cease farther comment3 though we take this
opportunity of noticing‚ that in the twelfth Verse of this Chapter,
where our English Transsation renderS, “ to them gave he power
to become the Sons of G0d‚” the Saxon Verfion has, “ he scaled
them one ² would, that they were God’s Barns‚'’ he sealbe him
anpealb ᾗ ln paepon [loces beapn. Children, not Sons, as the
learned Dr. Vincent observed to me, that the Original is τέκνα ese,
not υἱοι, for the term ‘⁶ Sons'’ tends to confound our ideas of the
Trinity in this Chapter.-But to resume our immediate objee‘L

The attentive reader must have observed, that the same Saxon
word is frequently spelt in a different manner even in a few lines;
