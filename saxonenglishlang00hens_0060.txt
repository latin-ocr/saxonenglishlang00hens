The numerous errors of Wheloc, the quondam Arabio and
Saxon Cambridge Professor, have been so fully proved by the sub-
sequent Editor of Beda, that it might appear unneceffary to give
any Extra& from his Works : but smee he has attempted to trans—

late part of a curious old English Poem into Latin verse, we will
just exhibit a Specimen.

That Helen was yclejzed this Battle first began;
ι That Heleine was icleped this Baitaille first began3
One high man was there before, that yelejzed was Dat-dan,
On heig man was ther bifore, that ycleped was Dardan,

Os him come the good Brutus, that was the fi'st man,
On him com the Gode Brutus, that was the furste man,
That Lord was in England, as I you tell can.
That Louerd was in Engelond‚ asc ic eu telle kan-

Sic Latina> dedi—haec unica faemina, prima.

Ante omnes saevit Trojani st’mina Belli

Hanc Britones dixere Helenam, sed Dardanus ille
Excelsus Bruti pater extitit, unde Britanni
Heroum sumpsere genus ; fortiffimus idem

Hunc orbem primus regere δε dominarier ansus.
