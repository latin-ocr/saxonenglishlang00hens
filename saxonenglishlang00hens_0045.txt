There are many other passages in this Will, that demand similar
Examinatiou and Illustration. The Land which Alfred's Grand-
father had entailed on the weaponed half, (that is) the Spear-half,
in Oppofition to the Spindle-half‚ and which, if transferred into a
Wife’s or Female Hand, he orders to be purchased by his Heirs‚
and restored to the proper Line, is constantly confounded with the
Aequifitions he had made, when the word is g astryndon, strength-
ened, restrained‚ or straitened‚ not begaet0n‚ as in the Introduelion
of this Record. In confirmation of this interpretation, we smd
him urging the justice of such restoration of property to the entailed
line, because he had bequeathed to his Heirs Male, many more
Estates than they would be neceffitated to repurchai‘e‚ that he
might have bestowed on Females. But we reserve further com-
ment to a future opportunity, in our historical Dissertation on Ranks
and services.

The next Specirnen we shall exhibit is an anticnt Proclamation
of Henry the third, which Somner considers a Saxon Recurd, Lord
Lyttleton an Old-cuglnh Document.—-Som. Dia. ad verbum ummn.
