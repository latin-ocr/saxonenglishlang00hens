been compelled‚ in the course of his investigationS, to consult the
Thesaurus of Hickes, the Leges Saxonicae of Wilkins, &c. and
finding it impossible to form any certain inference from their Latin
jargon, he was neceffitated to examine the Original‚ in its verna·
cular idiom. Of the result of this investigation let others judge;
but before condemnation is passed, let the evidence be candidly
weighed by the judgmcnt of a discerning jury. For this purpose
we 1hall submit the Original in Saxon Chnrznffiws, with the version
and Interpretation of the Editor's on oue page3 the Original, in
Roman Charaeters, with the literal verbatim Rendering‚ in italics,
on the other, that a just ² verdier of their merits may be returned
by an honest and impartial juryman.

To trifle away time is not the objec't of our researches. We
{hall therefore sele& a most curious Record for observation‚ the
very first that the learned Iliekes has inserted in his Dissertatio
Epistulam, and which he considers a valuable b document, con-
veying important information. This reports the Saxon process in
an Affize, or the manner of holding a grand Court of Judicature for
a County. It has dcservcdly occupied his peculiar attention and
engaged his particular comment. We cannot therefore be accused
of affling uncandidly in our sclefflon, since we begin with one of
our ablest scholars, take the first occurring Record in this part of
his publication, and which he has certainly endeavoured to illustrate
with precision. Far is it from our intention likewise to detra&
from the merit of such men, they have laboured for the great ad-
vantage of posterity3 but our immediate objeci is to prove, that
the mode of study adopted by them was insufficient to produce a
corre& knowledge of the Idioms of the Anglo—saxonic Language,
