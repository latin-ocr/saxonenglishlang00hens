Warton prefaces his work by a curious affertion that “ the saxon
Poet1·y has 110 connefflon with the nature or purpose of his under-
taking ;” but if any render will consult Hickes’s learned Thesaurus,
hc will find “ most ‘¹ Citations (not) extrac‘tcd from ancient Manu-
script Poems never before printed‚'’ but verbatim et literatim tran-
seribcd from the Anglo-saxon printed charaffie1s, without amend-
ment‚ οι· alteration, in the division or explanation of the Original¹
We shall exhibit one Extra& to facilitate the reading of such Poetry‚
in XVarton's Language‚ and our corresponding modern, accented,
and divided rythmically.

Miiden Alargczrel—-one Nigllt in stt-istm lay,

Meiden Margarete one nitt in prison lai,

Her came before Olihrius-—on that other Day.

Ho com biforn Olibrius on that other dai.

Meiden Margarete‚ lef up upon my lay,

And Jesu tlzou believast on—thou do him all away.
And lhu that thou levest on, thou do him al awey.
