'To the Saxon Students, especially the junior Members of the
University of Oxford, and those particularly from the northern side
of the Trent‚ we take leave to suggest a few brief observations on
the mode of cultivating a knowledge of the Anglo-saxon language,
When thoroughly acquainted with the charafierffi and capable of
easily discriminating betwixt b an p, p and p, consider ὃ and 1> or
even b as of the same power, and m, n, u, as frequently requiring
reciprocal changing, from the blundering of transcribers. (After
reading this Effay with some little attention‚) begin with the Saxon
Gospel of St. John, without any Transsation‚ and pronounce the
Consonants of each word distinffly, that is not understood. In
‘long words attend principally to the strong Consonants r, s, n, d,

prefixes and suffixes, and a person {killed in the pronunciation of
that tongue, will dex-ive great advantage from such circumstance.

affixes, affirm, confirm, and suffixos, firmness ⁸, &c. Thus from
the Stream with which we are acquainted we may trace the Sourcc,
and derive satisfac‘tion from the investigation. 1f a correspondiug
word does not immediately occur to the mind, we may frequently
