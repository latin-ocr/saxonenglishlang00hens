[* 54 ]“

The neader must long have observed, that we consider the Learn--
ing of Hickes‚ in his Anglo-saxon Grammar misemployed; and,-
the Introduetion to Lye's Diffionary of little authority. lndeed
we are convinced, that they have increased the difficulty of ac-
quiring a knowledge of this language. For in our native tongue
there are only two variations of the Substantive's Termination, into
s, the mark of the concurrence of two Nouus, or the fign of the
Plural Number, as ¹¹¹ Laud-scapes‚ Self-freedom's Love3 which in:
combination is frequently omitted, for we might say Self-freedom,.
love, as Self-love ; or an addition of en, another mode of forming
the Plural, as Ox, Oxen3 or a change of the Vowel, as Man,
Men, in the Saxon generally um„ as, Man, Mannum, Manig„
Monegum. ’

The construction of the Verb is the most fimple and easy, that¹
can be found i'n any language. There are only two InfleClions in..
the aclive Verb, the present, and the past, do, did. With the*
affistance of these two fimple Actives, and other verbs, equally
fimple, yet significant, every complex variation of the Greek, or
Latin, can be clearly expressed.> We will exemplify this from the
Latin, premiffirg, that, originally, when an idea of the present
was intended to be cmweyed, our forefathers pronounced the d soft,
th—³<50‚ when the past, hard, bv, did—Press’nt Singular„ I love,
or do love, thou love-imis, or lovenest, by abbreviation lovest, and
loves,—he love-do or loveth. Plural, we ¹¹ love-in, ye love—in, they
love-in. Pcst—1 love did, by conti-aenon lovedd, written loved.
Past and present jcined, with the· affistance of the Verb have. Ι

“ In Love—from the Saxon on, the a& ofrloving. Ben Jonson says, The persons.
plural were wont to be formed by adding en, (sostened from in,) thus loven, sayen,
complainen‚ but now, whmsoever is the cause, (one will bc suggested) it harh quite

grown ont of use, and that other so generally prevailed‚ that I dare not presume to

set this asoot again: Albeit (to tcll you my opinion) 1 am persuaded that the lack
hereof, well considered, will be found a great blemish to our Tongue. Jonson’s Gram.
