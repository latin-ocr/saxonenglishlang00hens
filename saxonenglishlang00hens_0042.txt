OF THE EDITOR.

And Ι beseech, in God's name,
and in his Saints‘‚ that of my Re-
lations noue, nor of my heirs
none do obstruet, none of the

freedom of those that Ι have‘re-
deemed. And for me the West-

SaxonNobles as lawful have pro-
nounced that Ι thern may leave
either free or bond whether 1
will. But I, for God's love, and
for my Soul’s advantage, will

the families at Domerham their
Laud-Deeds, and their free li-
berty such person to chuse, as to
them most agreeable may be;
