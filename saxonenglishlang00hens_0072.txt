the beloved. The whole of our Mother Language‚ we entertain
little doubt, will admit of fimilar illustrati0n; and if a few found
Scholars, well versed in English Literature, would thus dedicate a
few months attention to the cultivation of Saxon Learnfflg, there
is little question, but we should speedily obtain, not only a Grammar
superior to those of Lowth, and Jonson; not only a Saxon Lexicon,
on the principle of Scapula, with English Notes and Illustrations‚
but a Dictionary, not indeed more volumin0u83 though far more
valuable, than that of our late respectable, learned, laborious, and
conscientious Lexicographer. The literary object to which, we have
pledged ourselves, if supported, is of no less moment; but should
we be discouraged‚ that study, perhaps, may be continued by us at
some future period, which at present we only pretend to have cul-

tivated subserviently to a faithful Knowledge, of our antient British
History.

THE END.
