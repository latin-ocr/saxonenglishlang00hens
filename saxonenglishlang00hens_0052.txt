³ This Chronicle, edited by Gibson, before hc took his Master's chree, ap-
proaches nearer to the Original, than any Verflon or Transsation we have met with.
Gibson was afterwards Bissiop of Lontlon 3—Hc was a found Scholar‚ an able Divine.
and zealons Friend to our Establishment3 he ensored pure praElical Piety on true
Christian PrincipleS, not sor the grand ostentatiaus sake of “ maintaining the Pre-
eminence of our Church over all Protestant States‚'’ '¹¹¹ he countenanced not Sedlmies,
he encouragcd not Schismatics.

ὓ “ Never was so great a ssaughter in this island, fince the Angles and Saxons, the
fierce beginners of war, coming hither from the east, and secking Britain through the
wide sea, overcame the Britons excelling in honour, and gained poffession of their
land.” See Differtation 1. Warton’s Poetry.

· See a late circular Letter—and occafionally one Word, Sentence‚ or Αξὶὶοη gives a
truer Knowledge of the real Character, than the Amr displays on the Stage.—The bene-

volent, pionis, and orthodox Charles Baldwin of Manchester, a lay Gentleman, buta found
Divine, will probably enlarge on such subject.
