and that in our Rendering we have almost totally-disregardcd the
f Vowels. We have certainly adopted such system, and we sind it
to answer far beyond our expeaefilation ς not only in the interpreta-
tion of Saxon Recoxds, but in appropriating the Scite of Places in
the celebrated Book of Domesday. We might more rationally
expe& claffical spelling in a modern Country-fellow‚ than an
uniform mode of writing in our Saxon Ancestors, and we must
investigate the meaning of each in the same manner. To this
Principle another must be subjoined, that is, the Distinffiou of
Words that have an g affinity to each other in found, or that are
pronounced by the same organ, and which are often substituted for
each other. The Hebrew Divilion of Letters will here aslist us,
that is, their Discrimination into those pronounced by the Tmrgue,
Lips, Palate‚ Teeth‚ Throat, or such as are of the serpentine
description, or hiffing letters. We must farther note the Syllablea
that are lost in modern pronunciatiom as ge, a, in the beginning
of VVords, um, un, on, an, n, ες, &c. at the end: and also not

such alterati0n3 because the latter have frequently been mistook
for each other, and the first in antient Manuscripts cannot be dis-

than any instruftions we can suggest by certain Rides, bnt we
strongly recommend, to the Saxon Student, the aelnal pronunci-
ation of every word that appears unintelligible to him, and to
place particular emphalis on the Consonants. Without pnrl'uing
some such plan, it never would have been discovered that '¹ llelicolt,
