[ 4‘9 ]

Having proved the inadequacy of all our best Saxon Scholars to
convey accurate ideas of th'e ² ‘⁴ Britissi-saxon, Anglo-saxon, 01·
Ndrman-saxon Documents‚'’ through the medium of a ¹³ Latin
Transsation; and having, as we presume, shewn that the English
Tongue is the natural offspring of these Language8‚ (and Children
surely have more Affinity to their Puteum, and are better acquainted
with thern, than Aliens,) we will make an Extra& from the Gospel
of St. John, to manifest the found Divinity in the Version edited
by Junius, and then briefly suggest some Hints to Studeuts relative
to the best mode of cultivating the knowledge of such Literature.

The GOSPEL of ST. JOHN. Cum». 1.

and God was the lVortlz.
and Gode waes the word.

¹ Such are the artificial Divisions of the Μοόςτηε. VVarton's Eng. Pociry.

⁸ All the beautiful Precifion of our Language is lost in their Tenus. How is the
definite saxon meaning of gehepsumnerre‚ berc simmicnings, that is, Lansranc's
attempt to make the Archbishop of York swcar to obey the Summons os {hc Sec os
Canterbury‚ destroyed by Gibson's obsequium. Sax. Chron. p. 175.—or Xthloc's
prosessionem.

‘ Forming or firming, i. c. the Creaiion, or Essablishmcnt os things,

‘¹ There is no Attide, consequently, it cannot with propricty bc rendered word,
and what a train of thought does VVortli suggest—first as Goodness or Exci-nenec—
